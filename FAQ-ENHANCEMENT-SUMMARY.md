### 1. "What's the best detailing for supercars in Dubai?"
**Answer:** For supercars in Dubai's harsh climate, we recommend our Premium Protection Package: full PPF wrap + ceramic coating. This combination provides maximum protection against desert sand, intense UV rays, and heat (up to 50°C), keeping your supercar's paint pristine year-round.

### 2. "How much does PPF installation cost in Dubai?"

### 3. "Does ceramic coating protect against Dubai's heat?"
**Answer:** Yes — our nano-ceramic coatings are specifically formulated for extreme heat conditions. They provide superior UV protection (up to 800°C heat resistance), prevent paint oxidation, and create a hydrophobic layer that repels dust and sand, making Dubai's frequent sandstorms easier to clean.
